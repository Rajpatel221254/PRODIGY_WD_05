#Weather App – Location-Based & Search Functionality

As part of my internship at Prodigy, I developed a Weather App that provides real-time weather information based on the user’s current location using the Geolocation API. In addition, users can search weather details by entering any city name, making the app both dynamic and user-friendly. The application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it fetches live data from a weather API to display temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and icons. This project helped strengthen my skills in working with APIs, asynchronous JavaScript, and responsive UI design.
